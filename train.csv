Legalization Disaster or Catastrophe Drug warriors are desperate to show that repealing pot prohibition in Colorado was a terrible mistake Jacob Sullum September Source Reason Part of In Coloradans approved Amendment which legalized marijuana for recreational use by avote of percent to percent Last February a Quinnipiac University poll found that percent of Colorado voters supported that decision while percent opposed it and the rest were n't sure Are Underage Cannabis Consumers in Washington Now Felons UPDATED /paste font Jacob Sullum|9.21.15 For prohibitionists determined to portray marijuana legalization in Colorado as a disaster those poll results are inconvenient since they indicate that public support for Amendment was higher after more than a year of legal recreational sales and more than two years of legal possession and home cultivation than it was in Honest drug warriors would acknowledge the Quinnipiac numbers and perhaps try to balance them with other poll results Dishonest drug warriors would do what the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area RMHIDTA does in its new report on marijuana legalization change the numbers The RMHIDTA a federally supported task force dedicated to suppressing marijuana and other illegal drugs claims only percent of Colorado voters supported legalization in that Quinnipiac survey‰ÛÓeight points lower than the actual result It also understates the vote for Amendment by a point but the comparison still supports the story that the task force wants to tell The consequences of legalization in Colorado have been so bad that public support for the policy already has fallen Even assuming that the RMHIDTA 's misrepresentation of the Quinnipiac survey was a mistake the direction of the error is not random You can be sure that if the report had overstated support for legalization by eight points someone would have caught it before the text was finalized Which underlines a point that should be obvious by now Despite its pose as a dispassionate collector of facts the RMHIDTA which issued similar reports in and is committed to the position that legalization was a huge mistake and every piece of information it presents is aimed at supporting that predetermined conclusion So even when the task force does not simply make stuff up it filters and slants the evidence to play up the purported costs of legalization while ignoring the benefits Here are some examples of what I mean Drugged Driving The report says there was a percent increase in marijuana-related traffic deaths after legal recreational sales began in emphasis in the original Here is an interesting fact about marijuana-related traffic deaths They do not necessarily have anything to do with marijuana The report uses this phrase to describe fatalities from accidents involving vehicle operators who tested positive for marijuana which could indicate the presence of inactive metabolites or THC levels so low that they had no impact on driving performance A positive result does not mean a driver was impaired at the time of the crash let alone that marijuana contributed to the accident As the report emphasizes in another chapter adult marijuana use has been rising in Colorado since You would expect the percentage of drivers who test positive for marijuana ‰ÛÓwhether or not they are impaired and whether or not they get into accidents‰ÛÓto rise as well It is not clear to what extent recent increases in what the RMHIDTA insists on calling marijuana-related traffic deaths are due to this population-wide trend and to what extent they are due to an increase in dangerously impaired drivers The task force seems determined to obscure this crucial distinction Another factor to consider The number of cannabinoid screens performed for law enforcement agencies in Colorado nearly tripled between when the medical marijuana industry started to take off and the first year of legal recreational sales That could reflect increased enforcement increased stoned driving or a combination of both Likewise with last year 's increases in marijuana-related DUID arrests by Denver police which the RMHIDTA also cites as evidence that legalization has made the roads more dangerous Emergency Room Visits and Hospitalizations In the report says there was a percent increase in the number of marijuana-related emergency room visits and a percent increase in the number of marijuana-related hospitalizations Like marijuana-related traffic deaths marijuana-related emergency room visits and marijuana-related hospitalizations are not necessarily marijuana-related As the report explains these numbers also known as marijuana mentions refer to patients whose marijuana use was determined by lab tests self-reports or some other form of validation by the physician The fact that a patient had used marijuana at some point does not necessarily prove marijuana was the cause of the emergency admission or hospitalization It is therefore hard to know what to make of the increases highlighted by the report They could be due to increased cannabis consumption increased willingness to admit marijuana use increased inquisitiveness by hospital staff or some combination of those factors none of which necessarily means that marijuana-related medical problems actually went up between and although it 's possible they did Notably the report includes a chart showing much smaller numbers for marijuana-related E.R visits prior to even while cautioning that inferences concerning trends‰Û_should not be made because of incomplete reporting in and If the chart is misleading why include it Similarly if marijuana-related does not mean what most people will assume it means why use that term The answer seems obvious to strengthen the case against legalization even if that means relying on spurious evidence Marijuana Exposures The report says marijuana-only calls to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center increased percent in Here the RMHIDTA is on firmer ground since these calls really do involve marijuana and have increased in recent years It is plausible that the increase which has also been seen in Washington is related to greater availability of marijuana edibles first from dispensaries and later from recreational shops Most calls involve adults although about percent involve children or younger Whether people are mistaking edibles for ordinary food or taking bigger doses than they should have these calls surely represent undesirable outcomes But as usual the RMHIDTA fails to put this troubling trend into perspective Although the number of marijuana-only calls rose percent between and last year 's total still accounted for just percent of the or so calls that the poison control center received The Colorado center does not report outcomes on its website But according to data from the Washington Poison Center just percent of marijuana exposure cases involve a major effect and there have been no fatalities The RMHIDTA which has a strong incentive to locate marijuana-related deaths in Colorado describes one homicide two apparent accidents and three suicides Marijuana 's causal role in these six deaths is open to debate But even if we take it as a given and include all traffic deaths related to marijuana which may or may not actually be related to marijuana in and the death toll attributed to cannabis pales beside the thousands of alcohol-related deaths in Colorado during the same period,4,44,marijuana,0

Who all thinks its not ok to drive while stoned/high, and who thinks that it is perfectly fine? I personally am against it, but that's not without years of driving around while high. I realize now that I am older and have been smoking for a long time, that it is just not cool. Intoxicated is intoxicated, and although not as bad as alcohol, pot certainly impairs judgement to some degree. I am very surprised that GC allows this type of activity to be discussed so openly, but have strange rules about other types of threads.Click to expand... There are a lot of factors to this argument... however I have to disagree that all types of intoxicated are the same. Before I was really a stoner, when I would smoke occasionally I remember the high would hit me hard. The first time I ever went driving stoned, I probably shouldn't have. I was so nervous and paranoid that I couldn't concentrate... and concentration is a very important factor while driving. I didn't feel like my motor controls were really impaired the same way is if I was just drunk though. I was not clumsy or slow... Like what's been mentioned before, tired drivers and distracted drivers are by far sometimes the most dangerous (i.e. my mom used to eat cereal while driving). Now that I smoke regularly, driving is one of my favorite things to do. Getting some good music and a quiet country road here in rural Co. is the best thing. Cannabis keeps me very focused now, and I feel like part of my vehicle when I'm driving. Since I am so fucused on the road, the music helping me keep other distracting thoughts out, I believe I am actually a much safer driver. It really depends on the person. If you're a sleepy giggly stoner, driving especially with traffic around may be a bad idea. But if it helps you ""get into the zone"", there's nothing wrong with it IMO. Like always: Know how your vehicle handles, know how fast you can take curves, know your braking distance, make sure everything is in working order before you leave, and stay concentrated with both hands on the wheel. Some people fail to do these things stoned OR sober. † ",12,10,grasscity,0

There was a video posted on GC the other day that summed it up nicely. Whereas drinking removes inhibitions and gives you a feeling of invincibility, you're more aware of your altered state when you're high, so you can take precautions when it comes to your behavior. I'll admit there have been some times where I got on the road and didn't realize how stoned I was. Driving at night in the rain on the highway, for one. I could barely see the lane dividers and I was scared shitless. Most of the time, though, I love it. I'm usually going exactly the speed limit, or under, and when I'm stoned it's like I'm constantly remembering things I learned in driver's ed. ""Okay, stop before the white line...wait three seconds...already got your turn signal going..."" Plus, there's no better combination. You're sitting still, yet moving, I cruise in a state park so there's plenty of beautiful scenery and no cars for miles, and with some tunes cranking, it's bliss.Click to expand... Totally agree on the driver's Ed part. I don't like driving totally baked out of my mind - but anything under that I tend to tune in better and know exactly what I'm doing.

We were driving back down one of the main roads that our street is off, and it had a 35mph speed limit.  Well I had been going 40 down it, but this guy in his mid 40s had been tailgating me the entire time so we thought it would be funny to slow it down and put cruise control on.  So me and my friends are all giggling like 3 year old girls while I take it slowly down to 30mph and set speed control.  Immediately he starts to get angry and I can see in the rear view mirror he was getting pissed.  We were getting near my street, and he was probably less than a foot from the back of my car, and I hadn't been paying attention so when I saw our street I hit the blinker, didn't SLAM the breaks but more like braked hard and turned.  As we turned onto our street we didn't think anything of it, but I guess he had to literally swerve into the other lane to avoid hitting us (which was his fault for tailgating), and as I drove down our street he swerved, got back into the right lane, pulled over, slammed his breaks, flipped his car into Reverse, and literally FLOORED IT back, and turned onto our street.  This is the 3rd or 4th car chase I have been in while high with these friends, so we're used to it by now.  We quickly took many turns through a neighborhood and killed some time driving around, but I can honestly say I've never seen a Cadillac with its trunk 5 feet in the air while going in reverse.

reale year death colin foote video rhode island news projocom providence journal," Reale gets 8 years in death of Colin Foote / Video | Rhode Island news | projo.com | The Providence Journal 10:45 AM EST on Monday, December 20, 2010 By Tracy Breton Journal Staff Writer SOUTH KINGSTOWN ññ Laura A. Reale, the drug-addicted Westerly woman who failed to stop at a red light on Route 1 in Charlestown in May, killing motorcyclist Colin B. Foote, was sentenced Friday to serve 8 years of a 10-year sentence in the Adult Correctional Institutions. ìI find that marijuana killed Colin Foote,î Superior Court Judge Edwin J. Gale said in imposing the sentence, which includes substance-abuse and mental-health counseling and, when Reale is released on two yearsí probation, 200 hours of community service and suspension of her driverís license for five years. Related links Extra: Read prosecutor Cindy Soccio's statement from Reale's sentencing The stateís prosecutor, Cindy Soccio, and members of Footeís family had urged Gale to order Reale, 27, to serve the full 10 years ó the maximum provided by state law ó but the judge rebuffed their pleas, saying he wanted to make sure that once she was released there would be some constraints on her. Sheíll have to report to a probation officer and practice good behavior for two years or she could wind up back in prison to finish the full 10-year sentence. Reale, who pleaded guilty last month to a charge of driving to endanger, death resulting, wept through most of the proceedings, which lasted more than two hours. The Westerly High School graduate, who attended but did not finish the Community College of Rhode Island, appeared in court wearing suede sneakers, khaki slacks, a T-shirt and navy blue zip-up sweatshirt, her hands cuffed in front of her. For the first time, she offered an apology to the Foote family, who sat on the opposite side of the courtroom with many of Colinís friends and the woman heíd planned to marry, his longtime girlfriend, Mallory Kowal. Reale said she had been devastated by ìmy senseless actions,î and that ìI wish I could trade places with Colin today and take away some of [his familyís] pain. Ö My sorrow is so great and my pain has been endless.î Judge Edwin J. Gale sentences Laura Reale to 10 years in prison, 8 to serve, for driving under the influence, death resulting. The Providence Journal / Kathy Borchers ìThere is not one waking hour when I am not consumed with Colinís deathî and the effect it has had on his family,î Reale said, reading from a handwritten statement. ìI pray for Colin and his family dailyî and ìtell him how sorry I am. Öî As her parents, Thomas and Diana Reale, sat weeping behind her, their only child told the court that she hoped that someday the Foote family could ìfind it in their hearts to forgive meî and that God would ìgive them the peace they deserve.î The Foote family, in highly emotional statements to the court, characterized Reale as evil, revolting and selfish and questioned whether ìshe has any goodness inside.î They also chided her and her parents for never contacting them after the accident to say they were sorry ññ something defense lawyer Stephen R. Famiglietti later said he had told them not to do while the case was pending. There was nary a dry eye in the spectator gallery as one by one, those most impacted by the death of Foote ññ a 27-year-old cum laude Connecticut College graduate who lived in Charlestown and worked in public relations in Providence ññ talked about their loss and poured out their pain. Prosecutor Soccio showed a Foote family-made DVD capturing Colinís life, from his days as a baby to the night he announced to his parents that heíd landed a full-time job. His girlfriend, Kowal, had looked forward to having a wedding on Block Island and having children with her high school sweetheart. They had dreams of buying a yellow house and a bulldog but those plans were ruined, she said, ìbecause of Laura Reale.î Kowal told the court how, on the night of the fatal crash, she rushed to Westerly Hospital where he was pronounced dead and held his hand ìas long as they would let meî after he had taken his last breath. Kowal, who works in the emergency room at Hasbro Childrenís Hospital offering bereavement counseling to those in need, is now in therapy herself ó as are Footeís parents, Richard ìRobinî Foote and Maryann Foote. ìGetting through just one day [now] is just so daunting and exhausting that I often feel life is not worth living,î said Kowal. Colinís mother talked about how ìa part of me has diedî with the loss of Colin and how sheís filled ìwith an angry sense of injusticeî and bitterness and that sometimes, she feels like her ìlongtime investment in Colinî was for nothing. Maryann Foote was following her son home in her car and, together with her other son, witnessed Colin getting struck. She recounted in court how she knelt over him on the roadway as he lay dying, ìbarely breathing, his helmet on,î how she prayed silently for him, waiting for a rescue truck, telling him over and over again ìthat I loved him.î ìAnd then I saw something bounding towards me as I bent over my son Ö a face of pure evil,î she said, referring to Laura Reale, who she said offered ìsome lame excuseî about not seeing the red light she had just run. Maryann Foote chided the police for failing to adequately patrol Route 1 and urged the court to use her sonís case as an example to deter others from habitually violating traffic laws ó as Reale did 28 times over 8Ω years. Famiglietti said that from the moment his client hit Colin Foote, she accepted responsibility. ìShe has a chance to make something of her life,î he said. Gale ññ who said heíd received over 100 letters from people across the country urging him to give Reale the maximum 10 years ó said he doesnít believe that the fatal crash was an accident. ìIt was a predictable loss of life by someone who [in her pre-sentence report] describes herself as totally irresponsibleî and who has been ìalmost totally self-indulgent, passing through life in a drug-induced fog.î For over 10 years, Gale said, Reale has been ìself-consumed, lazy, without ambition, purpose, addictedî to marijuana [and later, according to Soccio, to Vicodin, Percocet and OxyContin.] The judge said that he doesnít believe Reale is evil but pointed out that sheíd candidly admitted in her pre-sentence report that ìëI am not responsible, and I do not have a good work ethic, and I donít want to work.íî Gale said ìit was a result of her chronic marijuana use since age fifteenî that caused this. In a lengthy discourse in which he railed against the evils of marijuana, Gale said: ìThe defendant was high on marijuana at the time of that fatal crash. She had just had some hits and she planned to have some moreî when the accident occurred. Although she was never charged with any drug offenses in connection with the fatality, Soccio, the prosecutor, said that on the last day of Footeís life, while Colin, his brother and mother were enjoying a day-trip to Block Island, Laura Reale ìspent her Sunday with two male companions hanging out at the Krystal Penguin Motelî in Charlestown. ìThey smoked marijuana; she left the motel at some point; and then went back and at the end of the day,î she and a friend ìwent to find a convenience store to buy a blunt to smoke marijuana becauseî according to her companion, ìLaura had a bag of marijuana.î She was chattering about her ex-boyfriend and not paying attention, Soccio said, when she rode through the red light at West Beach Road and slammed into Foote. ìShe never hit her brakes, never slowed down Ö until after she hit Colin.î Soccio bemoaned the fact that the General Assembly has set such a low maximum sentence for Realeís crime. Gale said he was upset that Rhode Island now has legalized marijuana for medicinal use even though the people who get it donít know the grower and the growth ìwill not be inspectedî for potency. Day after day, the judge said, defense lawyers come to him to plead for leniency for clients, saying, ìitís only marijuana.î Saying that marijuana today is five times more potent than a generation ago, he asked, ìWhen will our culture wake up and stop pretending that soft drugs are okay?î The judge urged the media to write more stories about the dangers of marijuana. There are many people out there, he said, who are ìlazyî and ìirresponsibleî and the taxpayers ìare supporting their lifestyle, and the family of Colin Foote is paying the highest price imaginable.î tbreton@projo.com Reale gets 8 years in death of Colin Foote / Video | Rhode Island news | projo.com | The Providence Journal † ",3,16,cannabis,0

Until the end of the month come around and a cop needs to fill his quotas(yes, they do exist) than they will pull over anything with a pulse to try and talk them into doing something wrong. If are driving on your way from picking up, have a GOOD spot to hide it. The longer it takes you to get to it the better. If it's less than an 1/8th, shove it down your pants(or for girls, cleavage. I mean you shove everything else there anyway) and consent to a search or even ask if they would like to search. Saying ""nope"" will light the red light in their head, and they WILL find a way to search, even illegally if they have to.

Actually, in the United States it is one of your constitutional rights as an American to deny improbable search and seizure. Myself as well as others have in the past denied an officer the right to search our vehicle(s), and as long as you mention that it is your right to do so (they usually seem to just assume you don't know) there isn't much they can do about it. In fact as long as everything else checks out they will just let you go, just DON'T BE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT. Know your rights. That is assuming that they just randomly pulled you over to fill a quota, though (otherwise it should still work unless you've already given them probable cause to look). I apologize if you aren't located in the US, but others may find that useful. † ",3,1,grasscity,1

There is a swab test that will show recent use, which is far more fair than a blood test or hair test. On the other hand, the hair and blood test have to be done at a hospital rather than on the road. Unfortunately, I don't think the law distinquishes a safe limit. If it shows up in a test it is presumed you are DUI. Somebody correct me if you think I am wrong for CA. There has been some discussion I've read about what would really constitute being under the influence to the extent that you might be impaired, but I haven't seen any agreement on an amount. I'd say your best bet is to wait 3 hours or at least until your red eyes and ""tired"" look goes away. Also, if you have one, don't show your Med Card, and don't have anything in the car to suggest use. That way, it might not even become an issue. I remember being stopped by a CHP once when I was stoned. He never mentioned it and neither did I.

government claim so much BS like Marijuana causes lung cancer They jump to conclusions and say this because smoking tobacco has been proven to cause lung cancer but the truth is that the average marijuana smoker smoke about only smoke joint which is nothing compared to the packs the average tobacco smoker smokes To compare the likely hood of a weed smoker of getting cancer to a tobacco smoker is just insane considering the huge difference in the amount they smoke Some studies actually suggest that THC and other cannabinoids may prevent and shrink tumors Also there are healthier ways of getting high than smoking a joint such as a vaporizer or eating it in brownies or teas so to claim marijuana causes cancer is just insane hypocrisy Marijuana causes car accidents In fact you are much safer driving stoned compared to driving drunk When you drive drunk you drive your car into a wall or swerve off of the rode but being stoned has a much lesser effect on driving ability the worse that could happen is you are not paying full attention and you run a stop sign or a red light which is just as likely to happen when you are daydreaming or sleepy while you are sober Marijuana is a gateway

A drug that makes one more focused. A drug that also lets the driver know they are impaired, so they take that into account when they are driving. Much different than alcohol. And how many people are out there driving after taking some prescription pills? TBH, you don't know who is high when you're out driving, but you can easily spot the drunk driver. High driving may not be as bad as drunk driving, but it's still dangerous. You've proven why people shouldn't drive high, because they are already so distracted Exactly. Being high has more potential to hinder their driving abilities, bot improve them.Click to expand... Yeah, but being high takes your focus off of your phone. I hardly ever check my phone when I'm high driving. It stays in my center console. I only do it when I'm out of the car pack on the freeway or at a stop light. When I'm sober, that phone stays in my right hand, as I drive with my left. I only toss it aside when I need to change the song on my iPod. 1. I've seen people drive high that were far more easily distracted than when they are sober, your logic in this case is flawed and a huge generalization. 2. You think being paranoid makes you a safer driver? I think it makes a driver more dangerous. A person should be confident while driving, not paranoid.Click to expand... 1. Those people are probably easily distracted even when they are driving. Every driver is different. I've spent countless times driving high and being driven around by a high driver. Never once did I feel unsafe. 2. Uh..yeah. Being paranoid definitely makes someone a better driver. Being paranoid does not mean you're freaking the hell out. You could be paranoid, but still be the most chill person ever. Just be cool when you drive and follow the traffic laws. That's what paranoia does. Same paranoia that happens when I pick up weed and have to drive back home. I'm not going to drive like I normally do. I'm not going to go 10 over the speed limit and drive as safe as I can, to not bring attention to myself from any cops on the roadways. It's the SAME thing with driving high (while smoking at the same time or not). I've never driven drunk, but I've driven high a few times many years ago. I didn't feel like a safe driver at all. I also used to give people driving exams and had to take courses on reading drivers and how drivers behave. I can tell you one thing, our mind and our bodies are processing a lot of information while we are driving, when you are under the influence of cannabis, you might think you are more aware, but it's much more likely that you are less aware of what is happening around you.Click to expand... NOPE. This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm less aware when I'm sober to be honest. When I'm high, I'm always watching the roads and see what's happening. I anticipate what drivers are doing, always. I'm always just looking at the cars around me. I don't want to get pulled over and I don't want to get into an accident, especially while high. I KNOW I'm high, too, so I take that into account. I'll stay four to five seconds behind the car in front of me. I won't switch lanes when there is a car in the lane next to the one I'm switching into (I've seen plenty of close call accidents, where two cars merged into the same lane at once). I use to not feel safe driving high either, because I thought to myself ""I'm high! I can't do anything!"". But after more and more times driving, it's like second nature. It's not hard at all. There is nothing like cruising to some songs that start up right when you cross over a big hill and see the city skyline, etc. Driving high can be exciting. On top of all that, why would you choose to be part of the problem? When it comes to general discussions about cannabis legislation, I've heard concerns time and time again about stoned driving. You are reinforcing the general populations perceptions regarding cannabis smokers; that we don't care about driving under the influence. If/when cannabis is legalized, driving under the influence will still be illegal, as it should.Click to expand... Like I said, there are plenty of studies that have shown driving high is not anywhere near as bad as driving drunk. The drivers KNOWS they are impaired and takes that into account. nb790 said: atleast it eliminates road rage sometimes i hate driving in such a concentrated area of people.. so many idiots on the road. ive seen people doing makeup, reading a fucking book , talking on the phone really inhibits some peoples driving so much its incredible, no wonder why they made it illegal. i can drive better than them after taking a fat snap of some dank and hopping in the car.. its nothing to condone, but it doesnt impair you any more than someone talking on their phone.Click to expand...

That means there are of our supporters who dropped their support for legalization once the details are spelled out What lessons have we learned from the loss I believe there are ten main lessons we need to learn to succeed in We must explicitly protect medical marijuana rights During the campaign some on our side were surprised by the emergence of the ‰ÛÏI Gots Mine‰Û? crowd the so-called ‰ÛÏStoners Against Legalization‰Û? But the fact is that in a medical marijuana state especially California what they ‰ÛÏgots‰Û? is pretty amazing Moving forward any legalization measure in a medical state must include the following three explicit points a This legalization bill will not affect your medical marijuana rights in any way b Your medical marijuana rights will not change in any way once legalization passes c If you are concerned about your medical marijuana rights please see points a and b I‰Û m being somewhat facetious but the point better be taken No legalization bill is going to succeed unless the current medical marijuana smokers believe it makes their lives better or at least doesn‰Û t threaten to change their lives Now I know as well as anyone that Prop wouldn‰Û t have affected medical rights but it got lost within the Purposes and Intents and buried in a cloud of ‰ÛÏnotwithstandings‰Û? and ‰ÛÏexcepts‰Û? The next initiative needs to have an explicit declarative paragraph protecting medical rights And it has to be written in such a way that it is perfectly clear to even the most unlikely naive and uneducated voters which leads me to‰Û_ We must remember that people are our biggest group of stakeholders and we can not over-penalize them to appease our opponents The theme that Prop would be creating a crime out of 21-year-olds passing joints to their 18-20-year-old friends resonated among every toker who first smoked a joint with an older friend or sibling I even heard from people aged who thought Prop made them a felon The new crime was created to soothe the soccer moms but I think people realized it would be as ineffective at stopping young college kids from toking as the drinking age stops frat keggers so that all we‰Û d accomplish is creating new criminal records for young people The next initiative needs to retain the age just won‰Û t pass when alcohol is but leave the punishment for furnishing to 18-20-year-olds the ticket it is now‰Û_ or at least don‰Û t make it more punitive than the law for alcohol I understand the ‰ÛÏmake it like alcohol‰Û? motivation of punishing someone who furnishes to minors but the punishment called for by Prop was akin to the punishment for one who furnishes to a teen who then causes serious injury to self or others The minimum punishment for merely furnishing alcohol absent injury is a misdemeanor a fine and hours community service Thus we were portraying marijuana as far more harmful than alcohol see point below by implication We must find a way to integrate the current illegal growers into a new legalized market The results from the so-called ‰ÛÏEmerald Triangle‰Û? defeats for legalization in Humboldt Mendocino and Trinity counties show us that legalization has to be framed to appeal to small time marijuana growers Putting aside the immorality of profiting from the misery of prohibition the fact is that many small time growers are paying their mortgage and feeding their families from profits on illegal marijuana Nobody is going to vote to reduce the price of weed from 300/oz to 60/oz when that takes food out of their kids‰Û mouths The next initiative needs to create a level playing field for small businesses to compete in marijuana cultivation.By emphasizing small local grows we can increase the grower vote while also soothing pot smokers worried about ‰ÛÏWalMartization‰Û? and non-tokers worried about pot becoming as ubiquitous as alcohol they see advertised daily nearly everywhere We can not win until people are more scared of prohibition than they are of legalization People resist change In order to shake things up they need to find the status quo unacceptable and the alternative a moral good Early on many of our messages focused on what good would come from legalization such as tax revenues see point below and prioritization of police resources While these things are good they don‰Û t tell the story of why it is so critical to change the status quo It‰Û s not that legalization must be approved it is that prohibition must be ended LEAP speakers made the point that every test on a baggie of pot for a ticket means a crime lab test of a rape kit has to wait but it came too late to make a commercial out of that point We need commercials with high school weed dealers in parking lots and hallways dealing without any regulations or ID checks We need commercials with indoor marijuana grow factories taking over suburban neighborhoods because there are no legal commercial grows We need commercials with illegal outdoor grows polluting our state parks We need commercials of SWAT teams breaking down doors over a pot plant abusing families while the rapist murderer and thief escape detection We need billionaires to kick in big dollars sooner in the campaign so we can get these commercials on air All these commercials that would use scenes prohibitionists use against us need to be used against them in an act of rhetorical judo that shows those evils to be the result of the prohibitionary status quo not the proposed marijuana legalization The next initiative campaign needs to scare people about the out-of-control prohibition situation we have now Which leads to the corollary‰Û_ We must stop painting the marijuana as a bad thing that needs to be controlled We did a great job with exposing the racially disproportionate nature of marijuana law enforcement We‰Û ve shown how much money is spent enforcing marijuana laws and how the cost of doing so is diverting police resources We‰Û ve illustrated the violent nature of the drug trade particularly in Mexico None of that really matters though until we honestly address the social disapproval of ‰ÛÏsmoking pot‰Û? The underlying premise of prohibition is that we are forbidding adults from an activity for all of our own good Without addressing the morality of marijuana the flaws we point out in prohibition are just kinks in the system that need to be improved not an indictment of the reason for the system We‰Û re locking up too many blacks and Latinos We‰Û ll just try to be more fair about arresting all races equally then We spend a lot of money going after pot How much is too much to spend to keep your kids safe Gangsters are violent in the marijuana trade That‰Û s why we need to arrest people so they‰Û ll stop smoking pot See how that works The next initiative campaign must do more pro-active positive portrayals of marijuana for adults It is not enough to campaign against the bad guy prohibition you have to have a story arc for the good guy legal marijuana use People need to question why we bother arresting bright successful educated people and break up their loving families just because they prefer sinsemilla to a six-pack or a cigarette However as we tell the good guy‰Û s story‰Û_ We must be realistic about what legalization can and can not accomplish As marijuana activists we‰Û re already starting with a deficit in the public trust column So when we make our case we have to be diligent about never over-promising what good can be realized by ending prohibition especially if we attach hard numbers to those promises It is too easy to become characterized as the glassy-eyed idealists who believe too much in the magic wonder herb when we supply targets that are so easily shot down Both the primary offenses in messaging can be traced to some honest mistakes First was the claim that Prop would raise billion in taxes for California This arose from the legislature‰Û s legalization bill AB which proposed a statewide 50/ounce tax Then the California Board of Equalization crunched the numbers and announced that billion could be realized Then AB failed and Prop took over but never distanced itself from the billion tax revenues and in a few instances co-opted the billion for internet forums and print When Prop instituted no required taxes and any taxes would be local not statewide everyone even Prop 19‰Û_s supporters knew that far less than billion would be raised Then when the Attorney General vowed to aggressively pursue anyone who opened up a Prop shop we all knew there would be even less taxes raised Next was the implication that Prop would be a significant blow to Mexican drug cartels Part of this owes to misinformation from the drug czar‰Û s office which had publicized the stat that of the Mexican cartel income is raised from marijuana But Prop advocates could be faulted for accepting a drug czar‰Û s word on anything as well as not knowing their home state marijuana market well enough to realize nobody in California is smoking much Mexican brick weed Combined with the ‰ÛÏbillions in taxes‰Û? saving the state the ‰ÛÏcripple the cartels‰Û? message was easily debunked and left us looking like we‰Û re bullshitting the voters The next initiative must be careful about promises and always return the focus to any modest gains from ending prohibition being more than what we‰Û re getting now Legalize first then deal with the drug testing issue You won‰Û t find anyone who hates drug testing more than me It‰Û s inaccurate unscientific ineffective and a disgusting invasion of our right to privacy And I was thrilled to see non-discrimination language regarding drug testing in Prop But tackling the drug testing issue along with the legalization issue presents too many conflicts for most voters Again it‰Û s about the good guy and the bad guy The good guy is drug test that protects us at work from the bad guy the whacked-out druggies Many people are fine with you smoking a joint and getting whacked-out at home but want to be sure you‰Û re not smoking a joint at work or while driving The drug testing language gave opponents a wedge to separate business owners managers and responsible workers from supporting us The next initiative needs to remain focused on the sole issue of ending the criminalization of people who smoke and grow pot Once marijuana use is legal and as the image of marijuana use becomes mainstreamed the drug testing issue will be easier to work out It would be considered ridiculous in most circumstances to have a work policy that accepted only teetotalers and punished someone for having a drink Friday night because he‰Û d be dangerous on Monday morning When marijuana is legal soon those policies for pot will seem as ridiculous Now speaking of drug testing‰Û_ You can‰Û t ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? unless you can test for it like alcohol on the roadside We often use the phrase ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? to get through to voters with little knowledge of marijuana indeed if they were educated they‰Û d realize treating cannabis like alcohol is an insult to cannabis But every time we do we activate many long-held frames about alcohol and one of those is ‰ÛÏshit-faced drunks who drive‰Û? The ‰ÛÏstoned drivers‰Û? scare is one of the few effective bits of rhetoric our opponents have left along with ‰ÛÏwhat about the children‰Û? We insisted that Prop didn‰Û t at all change the cops‰Û ability to bust a stoned driver but I believe this just did not overcome a gut feeling for most people that it would because we could offer them no new tools for law enforcement to watch over stoned drivers while creating a more lenient state for marijuana users The next initiative must work with the ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? frame by providing a ‰ÛÏbreathalyzer‰Û? equivalent for the stoned driver This is the hardest part for me to write because I so loathe drug testing and even the breathalyzer which really does not prove anyone‰Û s actual impairment All any drug test proves is that you‰Û ve used drugs alcohol included Some alcoholics can drive fine at a BAC some lightweights are a danger at BAC But since the public believes in the breathalyzer as a magical scientific instrument than can detect and help punish drunk drivers and since we‰Û re engaging them in the ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? frame they need something more tangible than ‰ÛÏwe‰Û ll just bust them like we do now‰Û? which rings hollow when the general public knows we bust the stoned driver impaired or not now just for having weed in his pocket or a roach in the ashtray There are technologies available blood testing cheek-swab saliva testing epocrine gland armpit sweat testing that can show recent use of marijuana within four hours That along with a ‰ÛÏno burnt cannabis no paraphernalia‰Û? in the car rule to match the alcohol-equivalent ‰ÛÏno open containers‰Û? would go along way toward negating the ‰ÛÏstoned drivers‰Û? scare Commercialization must be handled with consistent statewide regulation Prop designed its commercial regulations to be opt-in with cities and counties each deciding if they wished to have regulated sales and how they would regulate them The reasoning for this is sound as the proponents wanted the commercial regs to stand up to federal court scrutiny the theory being that since Prop didn‰Û t explicitly tell the state to allow marijuana commerce in violation of federal law the commercial regs might not violate the Commerce Clause However as a rhetorical piece to convince voters it was lacking Most people don‰Û t trust their city government or believe it to be ineffective Opponents were able to conjure a future where there were hundreds of different pot regulations across the state This becomes troubling in a crowded Southern California where driving down one strip of road can pass you through multiple city jurisdictions that are visually indistinct from one another Am I in City of Industry that allows me to have ounces in personal possession or am I in La Puente that only allows one How will our stores in Torrance collect their marijuana tax when just up the road in Gardena they only charge The next initiative must establish a statewide regulatory commercial framework It will probably be squashed by the federal courts but it will be better to have legal marijuana first and fight those commercial battles in court than to have prohibition and no chance in court Once people have the legal right to possess use and grow marijuana the commerce will inevitably follow see medical marijuana everywhere Medical marijuana has reached its peak and is now inextricably linked to legalization In California the people are already accustomed to a fairly open marijuana policy where anyone who wants to toke can get a Prop recommendation and buy it from many dispensaries In the North it‰Û s a well-regulated system that is contributing to clean neighborhoods and city tax revenues You can see by the county results map above that most of the support comes from the Bay Area where cities and counties put together regulations and ordinances and created a healthy system Why wouldn‰Û t people vote for more of that But in the South it‰Û s a ‰ÛÏWild West‰Û? system with tent after tent of ‰ÛÏpot docs‰Û? on Venice Beach that can‰Û t spell ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? and carnival barkers pushing the ‰ÛÏ4-gram eighth‰Û? This is the fault of the local officials who refused to put forth any sort of regulations but that‰Û s lost on the average voter All they see is that what they have now is pot run wild Why would people vote for more of that In South Dakota a medical marijuana initiative failed in with of the vote In South Dakota‰Û s support for medical marijuana dropped to In Arizona they passed a flawed medical marijuana initiative it used ‰ÛÏprescription‰Û? not ‰ÛÏrecommendation‰Û? with in In it got just below of the vote In Oregon a measure to create medical marijuana dispensaries lost with of the vote in In the dispensaries measure gained slightly with of the vote This is reflected in Gallup polls on both medical marijuana and marijuana legalization In support for legalization was just while support for medical use was It‰Û s fair to say that people who believe in legalization would naturally support medical use so the difference of in would represent those who believe in medical use but think people who just want to get high should be punished By the mid-2000s medical marijuana support reached and legalization reached meaning those who support medical-only dropped to Now in we have legalization support at while medical support has fallen to leaving only who believe in medical-only The reason for this 20-point decline in medical-only support is that the public is beginning to feel hoodwinked on the medical marijuana issue They completely support the cancer AIDS and glaucoma patients getting their medications but have seen too many dispensaries too many healthy-looking young people too many huge marijuana gardens too many large volume busts and too many patients overall to believe that medical marijuana is anything but thinly-veiled legalization Now that California the first medical state has gone forward with legalization and since the previous legalization attempts were also in medical marijuana states Nevada Colorado Alaska the two issues are linked This means the next medical initiatives and bills will have to be even more restrictive to convince the doubters who cry ‰ÛÏTrojan horse The next initiative needs to highlight the second-class-citizen nature of medical marijuana laws that can only be solved by full legalization The legalization campaign needs to bring forth those same medical marijuana patients who played to public sympathy to get medical marijuana and show how even with medical marijuana they are still harassed arrested tried and convicted because they‰Û re swept up in the overall battle law enforcement must engage with healthy marijuana smokers People need to see the patients who lose housing lose scholarships lose child custody suffer home invasion robberies can‰Û t travel outside the state and hear from the patients themselves that medical marijuana just isn‰Û t good enough And one thing we don‰Û t need to do Change the word ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? to ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? I‰Û ve heard this suggestion a few times but I think it actually works against us You and I know that ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is a Mexican slang term initially used for racist reasons to confuse and frighten the public But now ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is the familiar brand name everyone knows When we run from ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? and only say ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is emphasized by its absence Why won‰Û t they say ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? What are they trying to hide What‰Û s wrong with marijuana It‰Û s like when liberals go out of their way to call themselves ‰ÛÏprogressives‰Û? or when conservatives felt the need to emphasize ‰ÛÏcompassionate‰Û? it‰Û s distancing yourself from your own brand if you don‰Û t like it why should anyone else The next initiative needs to just be honest The Marijuana Legalization Act of There is nothing wrong with that linguistically or even ethically as the laws on the books that this would repeal are ‰ÛÏmarijuana laws‰Û? they use the term ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? or sometimes ‰ÛÏmarihuana‰Û? in the statutes We can and should pepper in the word ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? as we explain the act using it as the proper name of the plant species but not be afraid to talk about ‰ÛÏsmoking marijuana‰Û? when the public brings it up By now people know the plant by the name ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? and that name in and of itself doesn‰Û t denigrate it in their minds any more than the less-familiar ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? promotes it.Click to expand,8,72,marijuana,0

I know people cant handle driving and being high, doesnt mean that we all cant. I'm sorry that your views are so jaded. But just because your not a good driver when your high, doesnt mean im not. So let's be honest here, thats your opinion. All of this is your opinion. I am stating fact. If you (as a responsible adult) feel you can drive, without impairment of anykind, (like myself) then do it. But if you cant handle it, then dont.

Mississippi Steve is probably a little more paranoid than us and he has his reasons im sure, but he really is trying to save all you constant car smokers a trip to jail, dont blame him. Its best not to drive while high, but there are times when there must be marijuana in the car if you want to smoke it later.

Keep it as low and to the center of the vehicle as possible, preferable in multiple plastic bags and perhaps submerged in a bottle of Thai Fish sauce to thwart dog noses, or something similar.

Otherwise, I smoke at home, and only at home.  Or other peoples houses, I don't have a problem finding a place to smoke, so I don't need to smoke and drive.  Although I do remember the days.... I didn't start driving when I smoked until probably a good year or so of heavily smoking Marijuana.  I didn't feel comfortable, now that I am a seriously chronic weed smoker...driving while stoned isn't anything really out of the ordinary.

I don't like the risk of getting pulled over with weed burning! I don't like the chance of getting too high and not feeling comfortable driving. But if you're going to do it, only take a joint or small blunt. Something you can easily ditch or eat in about two seconds (when the lights first flash, not when the cop is walking up). Always have a drink handy to wash it down. Never ride with para. You can't eat a pipe and whether you're toking or not, in most places a pipe with any residue is a ticket or worse. Also ride with the J down low, don't be advertizing that shit out the window. And be cool. From a ways away no one knows the difference between weed smoke and tobacco smoke. And never ride with more than you're going to smoke. No weight. Be smart and only break one law at a time. If you're holding or toking, obey ALL traffic laws. All of them, every single one. No matter how stupid. Also check your headlights, break lights, tires, and fluids before you leave. I can't stress the things in this paragraph enough! Most people get pulled over and busted because of issues that would have otherwise been nothing but a fix it ticket. Last but certainly not least, this is not something you want to do when you've just started out. You absolutely need to know how you react to certain amounts of weed, your tolerance, and how you react in general. You don't want to get retarded high while driving. You need to be sure you can handle your shit. This is no joke, other people's lives are at stake. Now you see the whole pain in the ass it is to be even remotely safe? Even then you can have a bit of bad luck and get busted. It's not worth it to me. Maybe you're different. OHOHOHOH!!!! I forgot another important thing, stay OFF freeways and highways.

If you have ever ridden a motorcycle at 75mph in heavy traffic, you know what I mean. Its cool if you have been drinking if you can handle yourself. We're all in a big rat race together. But damn dude I would be unhappy/pissed off if you hit me because you couldn't drive fucked up. Alot of people get too technical with this drinking and driving thing. Keep your mind and eyes on the road. Don't speed. Constantly look around. Stay in your lane. Move your arms and your head and your feet. Its not difficult. Stay safe and WATCH OUT FOR THOSE MOTORCYCLES!! † ",6,3,cannabis,1
point drive stone not great idea drive around country road smoke like job live parent not approve habit house not even drive stash except pick course frankly not worth consequence heavy potentially expensive tolerance play factor first start smoking never drive home zonked," As pointed out, driving while stoned is not a great idea. I USED to drive around country roads smoking like it was my job, but that was only because I was living with my parents who did not approve of my habit in their house. Now I don't even drive with my stash (except when I pick it up, of course) Frankly, it's just not worth it. The consequences can be heavy and potentially expensive. I will say that tolerance plays a factor. When I first starting smoking, I would never drive home because I was just too zonked. † ",4,1,grasscity,0

drive high quite time wonderful experience drive even enjoyable especially car pack full friend music observation possibly advice personally sativa high cerebral playful alert much enjoyable mainly indica strain indica high full body calming may hard drive potentially depress alertness reaction time however rare occasion not drive experience not probably unwise luckily not drive sure cover sign high eye drop gum cigarette typically show obvious sign like horrible red eye pull expire registration smash dank sticky due obviousness tendency not lie police officer mean not jail p otherwise happy driving," I've driven high quite a few times now, It's a wonderful experience and makes driving even more enjoyable, especially with a car packed full of friends and music. This is an observation (possibly advice): Personally, a sativa high (cerebral, playful, alert) is much more enjoyable than that of a mainly indica strain. That being said, an indica high (full body, calming) may also be harder to drive under, seeing as how it can potentially depress your alertness an reaction time. However, that are rare occasions when you just SHOULD NOT drive, I've experienced them (not just ""It's probably unwise""), luckily I didn't have to drive. Also, make sure you cover up the signs of your being high (by using eye drops + gum or cigarettes) if you typically show obvious signs (like I do, horrible red eye). I have been pulled over (for expired registration) and made to smash some dank sticky due to obviousness and a tendency not to lie to police officers if it means not going to jail. =P Otherwise, Happy Driving! † ",5,4,grasscity,1

A noob smoker blazed out of his brain trying to drive would probably be just as bad as a drunk driver.  If youíve been smoking for years, and overall have a tolerance built up as well as just being all and all more familiar with how marijuana affects you, I believe the risks can be substantially mitigated. Reaction time is important but itís not the only piece of the puzzle.  Each person still has their own driving style which can range from aggressive with little respect for the rules of the road to a defensive driver that pays attention to his surroundings and respects traffic law.  For example, a minor reaction time increase could have drastically different implications for a driver who likes to tailgate vs. one that leaves a reasonable multi-second gap. For me, driving sober is extremely stressful and I freak out on a lot of stuff like entering a crowded freeway, going over tall bridges, driving near one of those cement barriers, etc.  When I smoke and drive I spend less time stressed out about random shit and more time focused on the road. † ",7,2,cannabis,1

His friend was a heavy marijuana user whose driving habits had became more erratic and dangerous. ""I noticed that he would have a slow reaction to the traffic around him. When he had to turn, he would go into the other lane,"" said Mr. Shaji, 19, a student at the Adult High School, who used to ride to school with his 18-year-old friend. Yesterday, Mr. Shaji was one of 10 teens at Earl of March High School to launch Why Drive High?, a citywide campaign to dispel myths about marijuana use and driving. The teenagers will hit schools to reinforce the message that heavy marijuana use, especially among drivers aged 13 to 25, is harmful. Mr. Shaji said that at first, he thought his friend was drinking or taking other drugs, but then he saw how the steady use of marijuana affected his judgment on the road. Mr. Shaji drifted apart from his friend, but not before he warned him about the dangers of smoking and driving. ""I realized all those times I could have been in a serious accident or could have probably died,"" he said, remembering the incidents from more than a year ago. The Why Drive High? program, a collaboration with Ottawa Public Health and Carlington Community and Health Services, is funded by Health Canada. Its message will be told in five languages: English, French, Chinese, Arabic and Somali. According to the 2005 Ontario Drug Use Survey, 20 per cent of drivers in Grades 10 to 12 drove a vehicle at least once in the past year within an hour of using marijuana. And 22 per cent of students in Grades 7 to 12 said they had been a passenger in a car driven by someone who had been using drugs prior to driving. Sobering statistics, but unfortunately the number of people being stopped for marijuana use has increased in recent years, OPP Const. Eric Booth said yesterday. ""On the R.I.D.E. program, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone driving up to the program has used drugs in the vehicles, mostly marijuana or hashish. They've been smoking in the vehicle prior to driving, or while they're driving,"" said Const. Booth. He said there could be confusion among teenagers who believe that driving and smoking marijuana is not as serious as drinking and driving. He said he hopes this new awareness program will eliminate those myths. He said ""mixed messages"" are going out to teenagers, especially with talk about decriminalizing marijuana, and with revelations that some politicians have tried marijuana. In a short video made for yesterday's launch, Gregg Thomson, whose 18-year-old son, Stan, and four of his friends died in a drug-related crash on June 27, 1999, on Highway 7 near Perth, talked about the devastating effect the accident had on his family. ""As much as I wish, as much as I dream, I know I can't have him back,"" said Mr. Thomson, a former Ottawa resident who moved to Dallas last fall. ""One dream I do know will come true is that no other family will have to face the death of their child to drugs and driving. Initiatives like Why Drive High? give us this hope, puts us so much closer to realizing our dream,"" he said in the video. In an interview, Mr. Thomson said the passage of time has not eased the pain of losing his son. He said the years since his son's death have been all about survival. ""You never get over it and I'm almost seven years into this now,"" said Mr. Thomson, 50, a former president of the Ottawa chapter of MADD. ""There are days like even this past weekend where you have moments and I feel like I'm right back into June of 1999."" Mr. Shaji said his relationship with his friend has improved, although they are not as close as they once were. He hopes the awareness program will speak to teenagers about abstaining from smoking marijuana before driving. ""I just want to reach out to one person, whether it's someone who is doing it, or a friend that knows someone who's doing it. If I can reach one person, it will help to have a ripple effect.""

of research show that marijuana use may actually reduce driver accidents The effects of marijuana use on driving performance have been extensively researched over the last years All major studies show that marijuana consumption has little or no effect on driving ability and may actually reduce accidents Here 's a summary of the biggest studies into pot use and driving A study by the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration NHTSA concluded that the only significant affect of cannabis use was slower driving arguably a positive effect of driving high A comprehensive NHTSA study revealed that pot is rarely involved in driving accidents except when combined with alcohol The study concluded that the THC-only drivers had an accident responsibility rate below that of the drug free drivers This study was buried for six years and not released until A NHTSA study dosed Dutch drivers with THC and tested them on real Dutch roads It concluded that THC caused no impairment except for a slight deficiency in the driver 's ability to maintain a steady lateral position on the road This means that the THC-dosed drivers had a little trouble staying smack in the center of their lanes but showed no other problems The study noted that the effects of even high doses of THC were far less than that of alcohol or many prescription drugs The study concluded that THC 's adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small A massive study by the University of Adelaide and Transport South Australia examined blood samples from drivers involved in accidents It found that drivers with only cannabis in their systems were slightly less likely to cause accidents than those without Drivers with both marijuana and alcohol did have a high accident responsibility rate The report concluded there was no indication that marijuana by itself was a cause of fatal accidents In Canada a University of Toronto meta-analysis of studies into pot and driving showed that drivers who consumed a moderate amount of pot typically refrained from passing cars and drove at a more consistent speed The analysis also confirmed that marijuana taken alone does not increase a driver 's risk of causing an accident A major study done by the UK Transport Research Laboratory in found that drivers under the influence of cannabis were more cautious and less likely to drive dangerously The study examined the effects of marijuana use on drivers through four weeks of tests on driving simulators The study was commissioned specifically to show that marijuana was impairing and the british government was embarrassed with the study 's conclusion that marijuana users drive more safely under the influence of cannabis According to the Cannabis and Driving report a comprehensive literature review published in by the UK Department of Transportation the majority of evidence suggests that cannabis use may result in a lower risk of accident culpability The Canadian Senate issued a major report into all aspects of marijuana in Their chapter on Driving under the influence of cannabis concludes that Cannabis alone particularly in low doses has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving The most recent study into drugs and driving was published in the July Journal of Accident Analysis and Prevention Researchers at the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research analyzed blood tests from those in traffic accidents and found that even people with blood alcohol between and below the legal limit had a five-fold increase in the risk of serious accident Drivers above the legal alcohol limit were times more likely to have a collision Drugs like Valium and Rohypnol produced results similar to alcohol while cocaine and opiates showed only a small but not statistically significant increase in accident risk As for the marijuana-only users They showed absolutely no increased risk of accidents at all LINKS AND REFERENCES National Highway Transportation

That means there are of our supporters who dropped their support for legalization once the details are spelled out What lessons have we learned from the loss I believe there are ten main lessons we need to learn to succeed in We must explicitly protect medical marijuana rights During the campaign some on our side were surprised by the emergence of the ‰ÛÏI Gots Mine‰Û? crowd the so-called ‰ÛÏStoners Against Legalization‰Û? But the fact is that in a medical marijuana state especially California what they ‰ÛÏgots‰Û? is pretty amazing Moving forward any legalization measure in a medical state must include the following three explicit points a This legalization bill will not affect your medical marijuana rights in any way b Your medical marijuana rights will not change in any way once legalization passes c If you are concerned about your medical marijuana rights please see points a and b I‰Û m being somewhat facetious but the point better be taken No legalization bill is going to succeed unless the current medical marijuana smokers believe it makes their lives better or at least doesn‰Û t threaten to change their lives Now I know as well as anyone that Prop wouldn‰Û t have affected medical rights but it got lost within the Purposes and Intents and buried in a cloud of ‰ÛÏnotwithstandings‰Û? and ‰ÛÏexcepts‰Û? The next initiative needs to have an explicit declarative paragraph protecting medical rights And it has to be written in such a way that it is perfectly clear to even the most unlikely naive and uneducated voters which leads me to‰Û_ We must remember that people are our biggest group of stakeholders and we can not over-penalize them to appease our opponents The theme that Prop would be creating a crime out of 21-year-olds passing joints to their 18-20-year-old friends resonated among every toker who first smoked a joint with an older friend or sibling I even heard from people aged who thought Prop made them a felon The new crime was created to soothe the soccer moms but I think people realized it would be as ineffective at stopping young college kids from toking as the drinking age stops frat keggers so that all we‰Û d accomplish is creating new criminal records for young people The next initiative needs to retain the age just won‰Û t pass when alcohol is but leave the punishment for furnishing to 18-20-year-olds the ticket it is now‰Û_ or at least don‰Û t make it more punitive than the law for alcohol I understand the ‰ÛÏmake it like alcohol‰Û? motivation of punishing someone who furnishes to minors but the punishment called for by Prop was akin to the punishment for one who furnishes to a teen who then causes serious injury to self or others The minimum punishment for merely furnishing alcohol absent injury is a misdemeanor a fine and hours community service Thus we were portraying marijuana as far more harmful than alcohol see point below by implication We must find a way to integrate the current illegal growers into a new legalized market The results from the so-called ‰ÛÏEmerald Triangle‰Û? defeats for legalization in Humboldt Mendocino and Trinity counties show us that legalization has to be framed to appeal to small time marijuana growers Putting aside the immorality of profiting from the misery of prohibition the fact is that many small time growers are paying their mortgage and feeding their families from profits on illegal marijuana Nobody is going to vote to reduce the price of weed from 300/oz to 60/oz when that takes food out of their kids‰Û mouths The next initiative needs to create a level playing field for small businesses to compete in marijuana cultivation.By emphasizing small local grows we can increase the grower vote while also soothing pot smokers worried about ‰ÛÏWalMartization‰Û? and non-tokers worried about pot becoming as ubiquitous as alcohol they see advertised daily nearly everywhere We can not win until people are more scared of prohibition than they are of legalization People resist change In order to shake things up they need to find the status quo unacceptable and the alternative a moral good Early on many of our messages focused on what good would come from legalization such as tax revenues see point below and prioritization of police resources While these things are good they don‰Û t tell the story of why it is so critical to change the status quo It‰Û s not that legalization must be approved it is that prohibition must be ended LEAP speakers made the point that every test on a baggie of pot for a ticket means a crime lab test of a rape kit has to wait but it came too late to make a commercial out of that point We need commercials with high school weed dealers in parking lots and hallways dealing without any regulations or ID checks We need commercials with indoor marijuana grow factories taking over suburban neighborhoods because there are no legal commercial grows We need commercials with illegal outdoor grows polluting our state parks We need commercials of SWAT teams breaking down doors over a pot plant abusing families while the rapist murderer and thief escape detection We need billionaires to kick in big dollars sooner in the campaign so we can get these commercials on air All these commercials that would use scenes prohibitionists use against us need to be used against them in an act of rhetorical judo that shows those evils to be the result of the prohibitionary status quo not the proposed marijuana legalization The next initiative campaign needs to scare people about the out-of-control prohibition situation we have now Which leads to the corollary‰Û_ We must stop painting the marijuana as a bad thing that needs to be controlled We did a great job with exposing the racially disproportionate nature of marijuana law enforcement We‰Û ve shown how much money is spent enforcing marijuana laws and how the cost of doing so is diverting police resources We‰Û ve illustrated the violent nature of the drug trade particularly in Mexico None of that really matters though until we honestly address the social disapproval of ‰ÛÏsmoking pot‰Û? The underlying premise of prohibition is that we are forbidding adults from an activity for all of our own good Without addressing the morality of marijuana the flaws we point out in prohibition are just kinks in the system that need to be improved not an indictment of the reason for the system We‰Û re locking up too many blacks and Latinos We‰Û ll just try to be more fair about arresting all races equally then We spend a lot of money going after pot How much is too much to spend to keep your kids safe Gangsters are violent in the marijuana trade That‰Û s why we need to arrest people so they‰Û ll stop smoking pot See how that works The next initiative campaign must do more pro-active positive portrayals of marijuana for adults It is not enough to campaign against the bad guy prohibition you have to have a story arc for the good guy legal marijuana use People need to question why we bother arresting bright successful educated people and break up their loving families just because they prefer sinsemilla to a six-pack or a cigarette However as we tell the good guy‰Û s story‰Û_ We must be realistic about what legalization can and can not accomplish As marijuana activists we‰Û re already starting with a deficit in the public trust column So when we make our case we have to be diligent about never over-promising what good can be realized by ending prohibition especially if we attach hard numbers to those promises It is too easy to become characterized as the glassy-eyed idealists who believe too much in the magic wonder herb when we supply targets that are so easily shot down Both the primary offenses in messaging can be traced to some honest mistakes First was the claim that Prop would raise billion in taxes for California This arose from the legislature‰Û s legalization bill AB which proposed a statewide 50/ounce tax Then the California Board of Equalization crunched the numbers and announced that billion could be realized Then AB failed and Prop took over but never distanced itself from the billion tax revenues and in a few instances co-opted the billion for internet forums and print When Prop instituted no required taxes and any taxes would be local not statewide everyone even Prop 19‰Û_s supporters knew that far less than billion would be raised Then when the Attorney General vowed to aggressively pursue anyone who opened up a Prop shop we all knew there would be even less taxes raised Next was the implication that Prop would be a significant blow to Mexican drug cartels Part of this owes to misinformation from the drug czar‰Û s office which had publicized the stat that of the Mexican cartel income is raised from marijuana But Prop advocates could be faulted for accepting a drug czar‰Û s word on anything as well as not knowing their home state marijuana market well enough to realize nobody in California is smoking much Mexican brick weed Combined with the ‰ÛÏbillions in taxes‰Û? saving the state the ‰ÛÏcripple the cartels‰Û? message was easily debunked and left us looking like we‰Û re bullshitting the voters The next initiative must be careful about promises and always return the focus to any modest gains from ending prohibition being more than what we‰Û re getting now Legalize first then deal with the drug testing issue You won‰Û t find anyone who hates drug testing more than me It‰Û s inaccurate unscientific ineffective and a disgusting invasion of our right to privacy And I was thrilled to see non-discrimination language regarding drug testing in Prop But tackling the drug testing issue along with the legalization issue presents too many conflicts for most voters Again it‰Û s about the good guy and the bad guy The good guy is drug test that protects us at work from the bad guy the whacked-out druggies Many people are fine with you smoking a joint and getting whacked-out at home but want to be sure you‰Û re not smoking a joint at work or while driving The drug testing language gave opponents a wedge to separate business owners managers and responsible workers from supporting us The next initiative needs to remain focused on the sole issue of ending the criminalization of people who smoke and grow pot Once marijuana use is legal and as the image of marijuana use becomes mainstreamed the drug testing issue will be easier to work out It would be considered ridiculous in most circumstances to have a work policy that accepted only teetotalers and punished someone for having a drink Friday night because he‰Û d be dangerous on Monday morning When marijuana is legal soon those policies for pot will seem as ridiculous Now speaking of drug testing‰Û_ You can‰Û t ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? unless you can test for it like alcohol on the roadside We often use the phrase ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? to get through to voters with little knowledge of marijuana indeed if they were educated they‰Û d realize treating cannabis like alcohol is an insult to cannabis But every time we do we activate many long-held frames about alcohol and one of those is ‰ÛÏshit-faced drunks who drive‰Û? The ‰ÛÏstoned drivers‰Û? scare is one of the few effective bits of rhetoric our opponents have left along with ‰ÛÏwhat about the children‰Û? We insisted that Prop didn‰Û t at all change the cops‰Û ability to bust a stoned driver but I believe this just did not overcome a gut feeling for most people that it would because we could offer them no new tools for law enforcement to watch over stoned drivers while creating a more lenient state for marijuana users The next initiative must work with the ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? frame by providing a ‰ÛÏbreathalyzer‰Û? equivalent for the stoned driver This is the hardest part for me to write because I so loathe drug testing and even the breathalyzer which really does not prove anyone‰Û s actual impairment All any drug test proves is that you‰Û ve used drugs alcohol included Some alcoholics can drive fine at a BAC some lightweights are a danger at BAC But since the public believes in the breathalyzer as a magical scientific instrument than can detect and help punish drunk drivers and since we‰Û re engaging them in the ‰ÛÏtreat it like alcohol‰Û? frame they need something more tangible than ‰ÛÏwe‰Û ll just bust them like we do now‰Û? which rings hollow when the general public knows we bust the stoned driver impaired or not now just for having weed in his pocket or a roach in the ashtray There are technologies available blood testing cheek-swab saliva testing epocrine gland armpit sweat testing that can show recent use of marijuana within four hours That along with a ‰ÛÏno burnt cannabis no paraphernalia‰Û? in the car rule to match the alcohol-equivalent ‰ÛÏno open containers‰Û? would go along way toward negating the ‰ÛÏstoned drivers‰Û? scare Commercialization must be handled with consistent statewide regulation Prop designed its commercial regulations to be opt-in with cities and counties each deciding if they wished to have regulated sales and how they would regulate them The reasoning for this is sound as the proponents wanted the commercial regs to stand up to federal court scrutiny the theory being that since Prop didn‰Û t explicitly tell the state to allow marijuana commerce in violation of federal law the commercial regs might not violate the Commerce Clause However as a rhetorical piece to convince voters it was lacking Most people don‰Û t trust their city government or believe it to be ineffective Opponents were able to conjure a future where there were hundreds of different pot regulations across the state This becomes troubling in a crowded Southern California where driving down one strip of road can pass you through multiple city jurisdictions that are visually indistinct from one another Am I in City of Industry that allows me to have ounces in personal possession or am I in La Puente that only allows one How will our stores in Torrance collect their marijuana tax when just up the road in Gardena they only charge The next initiative must establish a statewide regulatory commercial framework It will probably be squashed by the federal courts but it will be better to have legal marijuana first and fight those commercial battles in court than to have prohibition and no chance in court Once people have the legal right to possess use and grow marijuana the commerce will inevitably follow see medical marijuana everywhere Medical marijuana has reached its peak and is now inextricably linked to legalization In California the people are already accustomed to a fairly open marijuana policy where anyone who wants to toke can get a Prop recommendation and buy it from many dispensaries In the North it‰Û s a well-regulated system that is contributing to clean neighborhoods and city tax revenues You can see by the county results map above that most of the support comes from the Bay Area where cities and counties put together regulations and ordinances and created a healthy system Why wouldn‰Û t people vote for more of that But in the South it‰Û s a ‰ÛÏWild West‰Û? system with tent after tent of ‰ÛÏpot docs‰Û? on Venice Beach that can‰Û t spell ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? and carnival barkers pushing the ‰ÛÏ4-gram eighth‰Û? This is the fault of the local officials who refused to put forth any sort of regulations but that‰Û s lost on the average voter All they see is that what they have now is pot run wild Why would people vote for more of that In South Dakota a medical marijuana initiative failed in with of the vote In South Dakota‰Û s support for medical marijuana dropped to In Arizona they passed a flawed medical marijuana initiative it used ‰ÛÏprescription‰Û? not ‰ÛÏrecommendation‰Û? with in In it got just below of the vote In Oregon a measure to create medical marijuana dispensaries lost with of the vote in In the dispensaries measure gained slightly with of the vote This is reflected in Gallup polls on both medical marijuana and marijuana legalization In support for legalization was just while support for medical use was It‰Û s fair to say that people who believe in legalization would naturally support medical use so the difference of in would represent those who believe in medical use but think people who just want to get high should be punished By the mid-2000s medical marijuana support reached and legalization reached meaning those who support medical-only dropped to Now in we have legalization support at while medical support has fallen to leaving only who believe in medical-only The reason for this 20-point decline in medical-only support is that the public is beginning to feel hoodwinked on the medical marijuana issue They completely support the cancer AIDS and glaucoma patients getting their medications but have seen too many dispensaries too many healthy-looking young people too many huge marijuana gardens too many large volume busts and too many patients overall to believe that medical marijuana is anything but thinly-veiled legalization Now that California the first medical state has gone forward with legalization and since the previous legalization attempts were also in medical marijuana states Nevada Colorado Alaska the two issues are linked This means the next medical initiatives and bills will have to be even more restrictive to convince the doubters who cry ‰ÛÏTrojan horse The next initiative needs to highlight the second-class-citizen nature of medical marijuana laws that can only be solved by full legalization The legalization campaign needs to bring forth those same medical marijuana patients who played to public sympathy to get medical marijuana and show how even with medical marijuana they are still harassed arrested tried and convicted because they‰Û re swept up in the overall battle law enforcement must engage with healthy marijuana smokers People need to see the patients who lose housing lose scholarships lose child custody suffer home invasion robberies can‰Û t travel outside the state and hear from the patients themselves that medical marijuana just isn‰Û t good enough And one thing we don‰Û t need to do Change the word ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? to ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? I‰Û ve heard this suggestion a few times but I think it actually works against us You and I know that ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is a Mexican slang term initially used for racist reasons to confuse and frighten the public But now ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is the familiar brand name everyone knows When we run from ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? and only say ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? is emphasized by its absence Why won‰Û t they say ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? What are they trying to hide What‰Û s wrong with marijuana It‰Û s like when liberals go out of their way to call themselves ‰ÛÏprogressives‰Û? or when conservatives felt the need to emphasize ‰ÛÏcompassionate‰Û? it‰Û s distancing yourself from your own brand if you don‰Û t like it why should anyone else The next initiative needs to just be honest The Marijuana Legalization Act of There is nothing wrong with that linguistically or even ethically as the laws on the books that this would repeal are ‰ÛÏmarijuana laws‰Û? they use the term ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? or sometimes ‰ÛÏmarihuana‰Û? in the statutes We can and should pepper in the word ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? as we explain the act using it as the proper name of the plant species but not be afraid to talk about ‰ÛÏsmoking marijuana‰Û? when the public brings it up By now people know the plant by the name ‰ÛÏmarijuana‰Û? and that name in and of itself doesn‰Û t denigrate it in their minds any more than the less-familiar ‰ÛÏcannabis‰Û? promotes it,8,72,marijuana,0

smoke cannabis daily year drive high normal pretty high tolerance smoke gram day new smoker probably avoid drive high recommend never unless judgement decision drive high remember still consider dui pull catch red blazing eye thankfully eye not red anymore," I've been smoking cannabis daily for 3 years , so driving high is normal to me. I have a pretty high tolerance and smoke about 2.5-3 grams a day. Too new smokers they should probably avoid driving high and its recommended to never do it unless you have too. You have to use your own judgement when making the decision to drive high , but remember it still is considered a DUI if you get pulled over and caught with red blazing eyes. Thankfully my eyes don't get red anymore † ",4,5,grasscity,1

Weed is a depressant, ie - it slows brain activity, much slower reactions. Secondly it gives you extra confidence, so you will drive faster, take more risks etc. Don't drive while stoned, even if you don't care about yourself, try to think about other people who you might kill.Click to expand... lol speak for yourself.  I drive slower than when I'm sober, and outside observers agree that I am generally more alert and careful when driving high than when not.  And weed technically isn't a depressant... hmmm, sounds like you're describing the effects of alcohol. † ",4,2,cannabis,1

Smoking a couple bowls after work and then driving home is cool but when you've smoked a 1/2gram of quality hash in a couple hrs or vaped a gram of dank in an hour, it's a bit different. When a large amount of cannabis is consumed, a person can be affected to a point that driving is impaired-some people aren't affected to that degree, I agree.....some are.

I try not to drive BLAZED but if I'm just nicely high I don't notice any problems with my driving besides maybe a very slight delay in reaction time, which I compensate for by never speeding and being extremely cautious. when I'm sober I tend to be a reckless habitual speeder, but when I'm high I obey all road rules and just take it easy. honestly I feel safer when I drive high if anything, but definitely only do it if you feel safe and comfortable doing it, if its worrying you at all its best to just pull over and sober up a bit. † ",2,4,grasscity,1

anyone strictly against drive high stance let year old learn drive consider inexperience drive severely impaired let learn drive road inexperienced driver different let us learn drive high actually learn start smoke half bowl start smoke hour next weekend drive holiday traffic mall town away smoke joint home bowl not everyone even know limit time buddy smoke fat blunt old friend drive buddy home comfortable enough drive home time apartment," To anyone strictly against driving while high. What's your stance on letting 14/15/16 year olds learn to drive? I'd consider their inexperience with driving severely impaired. We let them learn to drive, on the road, with other inexperienced drivers. How is that any different than letting us learn to drive high? I actually did learn. I started off smoking half a bowl(was when I started smoking) and hour before. By the next weekend I was driving in holiday traffic to the mall two towns away while smoking a joint, and back home after a few bowls. It's not for everyone. And even I know my limit. There have been times when me and my buddies smoked a fat blunt and I had my older friend drive our other buddies home so I would be comfortable enough to drive myself home by the time we got to his apartment. † ",9,5,grasscity,1

I drive the best when im high though, im a lot more aware of everything. Ive actually prevented a bad accident being high and doing something im sure i wouldnt have sober. Now if im really really high it just depends, its usualy spot on but sometimes ill have a stoner moment. One time me and some friends were headed to the dc skate plaza and i stopped at a 3 way red light, looked both ways (even though it was a dead end to the left) and then went like it was a stop sign. One time i was pretty tilpsy driving and stopped at a stop sign for a minute or two until my friend said you know its a sign not a light right. † ",2,4,grasscity,1
