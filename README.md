# Text-Classification

This is a group project for IS5126 Hands-On	With Business Analytics taken under the Master of Science in Business Analytics programme in NUS. The project was on the causality analysis of marijuana legalization on an increase in fatal car accidents in the US. This part of the project on text classification of marijuana forum posts was done soley by me. Forum posts from popular marijuana forums were scrapped by my groupmates and is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cvtcJC0MortJ-1xQTmX8TaodV_Hr1p_W. Text pre-processing was performed in Python while simple text classification models were built using the RTextTools package in R. Relevant sections of the report was also included for more detailed description of the analysis performed.
